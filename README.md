                                                            # **Doctor Patient App**

       This is a MEAN stack application where frontend is built using Angular framework, backend using Nodejs and Express and MongoDB is used as a database.

       

The entire code structure is divided into two folders:-
  1. Doctor-patient-backend
  2. Doctor-patient-frontend

     

Following are the steps to run the backend application locally:-
   1. Clone the repository into your local system.
   2. Change the directory to backend folder. i.e for windows use the command--> cd doctor-patient-backend.
   3. Run the command **npm install or npm i** to install all the nodejs dependencies used in the project.
   4. Finally, run the command **npm start** to start the backend application.
   5. The nodejs application runs on port **3003**.



Following are the steps to run the frontend application locally:-
   1. Change the directory to frontend folder. i.e for windows use the command--> cd doctor-patient-frontend.
   2. Run the command **npm install or npm i** to install all the angular dependencies used in the project.
   3. Finally, run the command **npm start** to start the frontend application.
   4. The angular application runs on port **4200**.


Once both the server is up and running we can access the application from the browser from port 4200.
